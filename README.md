# CardioRural

**Preventing cardiovascular disease in rural African communities using data-driven mobile screening tools.**

CardioRural is a lightweight, open-source cardiovascular risk assessment tool built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). It is designed to bring preventive heart health screening to underserved rural populations through mobile and offline-friendly technology.

## 💡 Why This Matters

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death in Nigeria—and rural communities are hit the hardest due to lack of access to early detection tools. CardioRural helps bridge this gap by:

- Using simple clinical questions to estimate risk
- Offering personalized lifestyle guidance
- Making CVD screening accessible on mobile

## 🔧 Features (MVP)

- Simple user interface (Streamlit)
- Inputs: age, sex, BP status, diabetes, smoking, etc.
- Outputs: Low, Moderate, or High CVD risk
- Health advice based on risk score

---

## 🧪 How It Works

This version uses a **rule-based risk scoring logic** inspired by WHO/Framingham guidelines. In future iterations, we’ll integrate real patient data and predictive modeling.

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn (planned)
