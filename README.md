# CardioRural

**Preventing cardiovascular disease in rural African communities using data-driven mobile screening tools.**

CardioRural is an open-source, mobile-friendly cardiovascular risk assessment tool built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). It‚Äôs designed to support underserved rural populations by enabling preventive heart screening through accessible technology.

## üí° Why CardioRural?

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a top cause of death in Nigeria, with rural communities disproportionately affected due to limited access to early screening tools.

CardioRural bridges this gap by:
- Using simple clinical inputs to estimate risk
- Delivering personalized lifestyle tips
- Running on mobile devices with offline potential

---

## üîß Key Features

- Intuitive, mobile-first user interface
- Collects core health metrics: age, sex, blood pressure, chest pain, blood sugar, etc.
- Predicts heart disease risk (Low, Moderate, High)
- Provides health guidance based on risk score

---

## üß™ How It Works

This version uses a **trained machine learning model (Logistic Regression)** to estimate heart disease risk. Built using:
- Publicly available datasets (e.g., [Kaggle Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction))
- Preprocessing pipeline with `ColumnTransformer`
- Scikit-learn model serialized via `joblib`

Planned upgrades:
- Tailored models for African populations
- Real-world community data integration
